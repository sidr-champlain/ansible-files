# ansible-files

Ansible files for my virtual machine infrastructure. I have separated the above files into two folders. 
One is for yum (CentOS, Fedora, RHEL) and the other is for apt (Ubuntu, Debian). Feel free to give each file a try, make sure you have ansible downloaded and configured correctly. 

I currently donâ€™t have a wiki guide on how to set that up. I will shortly. 

However, if you already have set it up, my examples contain the user deployer and the hosts are webservers and ubuntu. Feel free to change that to your specific need
